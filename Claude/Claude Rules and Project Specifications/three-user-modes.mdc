# Three User Modes (Role-Based Logic)

Support three distinct views. Provide a **Role Selection** screen at signup.

## A. Player Mode ("My Journey")

**Focus:** Personal growth, gamification, and safety.

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Daily Vibe Check-in** | "How are you feeling?" (soreness tracker). If "My arm hurts" → block pitching drills, show Recovery/Stretching instead. |
| **Mamba Feed** | Daily motivational quote or video (Kobe Bryant / Mamba Mentality or college softball highlights). |
| **Coach Me** | One-click video upload for instant mechanic feedback. |

## B. Team Mode ("Coach" View)

**Focus:** Managing a roster of 12–15 players.

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Practice Architect** | Auto-generate practice plans (e.g. "2-Hour Defensive Focus") that split the team into stations: Infield, Outfield, Catcher. |
| **Roster Health** | Dashboard showing players as **Red/Injured** or **Green/Ready** based on their inputs. |

## C. Pitching Coach Mode ("Specialist" View)

**Focus:** Remote training for specific students.

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Stable Management** | Assign "Homework Drills" (e.g. "Do 20 K-Drills") to a specific player's app. |
| **Split-Screen Analysis** | Compare a student's video side-by-side with a **Pro Model** from the library. |

## Data & Execution

- **Database:** `users` (or equivalent) must include a **role** column to support Player / Team Coach / Pitching Coach.
- **Role Selection:** Required at signup; gate subsequent flows by selected role.
