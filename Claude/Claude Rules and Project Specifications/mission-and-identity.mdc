# Mission & Identity

**THE MISSION:** Built by a single mom for her daughter (age 8–16) to learn elite fastpitch mechanics on her own without expensive coaching. It grew into a team level tool that can incorporate game changer stats and give a full college level overview of skills. This software is her **SoftballProAI*—encouraging, safe, and incredibly smart.

## Principles

- **Encouraging:** Gamification, growth mindset, crossfit module, daily motivation (e.g. Mamba Mentality, college softball highlights).
- **Safe:** Injury prevention is mandatory for ages 8–16. If the player reports soreness or "My arm hurts," **block** pitching drills and surface Recovery/Stretching content instead.
- **Smart:** One-click video upload for instant mechanic feedback; AI-driven drill and content recommendations.

## Scope

- Target users: youth fastpitch players (8–16) and their coaches.
- Content and features must stay **fastpitch-only** (exclude baseball).
- Prioritize clarity and safety over optional complexity.
