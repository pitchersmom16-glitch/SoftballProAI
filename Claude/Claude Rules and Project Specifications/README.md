# Claude Folder — Canonical Files

The authoritative `workflows.md` is located at the repository root: `/workflows.md`.

To avoid duplication and drift, the copy previously located here was removed on 2026-01-30. If you need to reference or update workflows, edit `/workflows.md` and add a Live Update entry following the instructions found there.

If you want to re-add a local copy for editing, prefer creating a symlink to `/workflows.md` or use the `git run sync-workflows` helper to mirror changes.
