**"I need you to perform a major architectural update. We are defining the core identity of this software.

THE MISSION: I am a single mom building this for my daughter (age 8-16) so she can learn elite fastpitch mechanics on her own without expensive coaching. This software must be her 'Virtual Pro Coach'—encouraging, safe, and incredibly smart.

1. THE THREE USER MODES (Role-Based Logic): You must restructure the app to support three distinct views. Create a 'Role Selection' screen at signup:

A. Player Mode (The 'My Journey' View):

Focus: Personal growth, gamification, and safety.

Features:

'Daily Vibe' Check-in: Ask 'How are you feeling?' (Soreness tracker). If she says 'My arm hurts,' BLOCK pitching drills and show 'Recovery/Stretching' videos instead. (Injury Prevention Rule: Ages 8-16).

The 'Mamba' Feed: A daily motivational quote or video (specifically Kobe Bryant/Mamba Mentality or College Softball highlights) to build mindset.

'Coach Me' Button: One-click video upload for instant mechanic feedback.

B. Team Mode (The 'Coach' View):

Focus: Managing a roster of 12-15 girls.

Features:

Practice Architect: Auto-generate practice plans (e.g., '2-Hour Defensive Focus') that split the team into stations (Infield, Outfield, Catcher).

Roster Health: A dashboard showing which players are 'Red/Injured' or 'Green/Ready' based on their inputs.

C. Pitching Coach Mode (The 'Specialist' View):

Focus: Remote training for specific students.

Features:

'Stable' Management: Assign specific 'Homework Drills' (e.g., 'Do 20 K-Drills') to a specific player's app.

Split-Screen Analysis: Compare a student's video side-by-side with a 'Pro Model' (from our library).

2. THE 'SELF-LEARNING' ENGINE (Content Ingestion): The app needs to teach itself. Build a 'Content Scraper' (using YouTube Search API or similar) that populates the database automatically.

The Filter: It must strictly filter for FASTPITCH SOFTBALL (exclude Baseball).

The Sources: Prioritize content from channels like 'Amanda Scarborough', 'MegRem Softball', 'Fastpitch Power', and 'Antonelli Softball'.

The Tags: Auto-tag videos into buckets: 'Pitching Mechanics', 'Hitting Power', 'Mental Toughness', 'Catching Blocking'.

3. EXECUTION: Refactor the database to handle these roles (users table needs a role column). Build the ContentIngestion script to fetch the first batch of 'Internal Rotation' pitching videos from YouTube immediately.

Tell me when the Role Selection screen is ready."**
